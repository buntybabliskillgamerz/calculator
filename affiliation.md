# Affiliation and Internal Roles

This document outlines publicly accessible information regarding affiliation with the Yumic Organization.

Affiliation is a structured process governed by internal evaluation systems. It is not application-based and does not follow open recruitment models.

Consideration for internal roles is determined through documented observation rather than formal requests.

## Role Categories

The Yumic Organization recognizes multiple internal role categories, including but not limited to:

- Research Functions
- Security and Oversight
- Intelligence and Analysis
- Field Operations
- Administrative Coordination

Assignment to any role is conditional and subject to periodic reassessment.

## Evaluation Principles

Evaluation emphasizes:
- Consistency over intensity
- Behavioral patterns over isolated actions
- Structural alignment over individual preference

Affiliation status may change based on documented outcomes.

## Limitations

Public documentation does not disclose:
- Evaluation thresholds
- Assignment criteria
- Internal decision processes
- Role-specific authority limits

This omission is intentional.
