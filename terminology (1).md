# Terminology and Classification Reference — Yumic Organization

This document defines standardized terminology used across publicly accessible Yumic Organization records. Each term reflects distinct usage observed in archival material. Definitions emphasize purpose, scope, and limitation without directive intent.

## Clearance

A documented level of access assigned to an individual, role, or system.
Clearance determines visibility of records, locations, and procedural references.
Levels are contextual and may differ between divisions.
Clearance assignments are reviewed during scheduled audits.

## Protocol

A formally recorded procedure governing a specific category of actions.
Protocols exist to reduce ambiguity and ensure consistency.
Deviation is documented rather than immediately corrected.
Protocols may be revised following longitudinal review.

## Evaluation

A process used to assess behavior, outcomes, and consistency over time.
Evaluations focus on patterns rather than isolated incidents.
Results may influence access scope or role assignment.
Evaluation records are retained for archival comparison.

## Division

A functional subdivision responsible for a defined operational domain.
Divisions reduce authority overlap and clarify responsibility.
Each division maintains independent internal records.
Coordination between divisions follows formal channels.

## Authority

Contextual permission to act within defined organizational limits.
Authority is role-bound and non-transferable.
Use of authority is logged for accountability.
Authority may be revoked without retroactive change.

## Oversight

The process of reviewing systems, roles, or outcomes for alignment.
Oversight focuses on structure rather than individuals.
It is typically indirect and documentation-driven.
Oversight does not imply direct operational control.

## Record

A preserved entry documenting an observation, outcome, or revision.
Records serve historical and analytical purposes.
They are not altered once finalized.
Corrections are appended rather than replaced.

## Archive

A collection of preserved records maintained for continuity.
Archives prioritize long-term accessibility over immediacy.
Content is organized by classification rather than chronology.
Not all records are publicly accessible.

## Assignment

A documented allocation of responsibility or task scope.
Assignments are contextual and time-bound.
Completion status is recorded separately.
Assignments do not imply permanence.

## Assessment

A focused review of a specific condition or outcome.
Assessments are narrower in scope than evaluations.
Findings are documented without immediate action.
Assessments may inform later review cycles.

## Coordination

The alignment of actions across roles or divisions.
Coordination reduces procedural conflict.
It is achieved through documented communication.
Authority boundaries remain unchanged during coordination.

## Containment

A status indicating restricted interaction with a system or area.
Containment is preventative rather than punitive.
Conditions are reviewed periodically.
Containment status is documented and reversible.

## Classification

A labeling system used to organize records and systems.
Classification improves retrieval and consistency.
Categories may evolve over time.
Reclassification is logged as a separate action.

## Observation

The act of recording behavior or conditions without intervention.
Observations are descriptive rather than interpretive.
They form the basis for later analysis.
Observation alone does not trigger action.

## Review Cycle

A scheduled period for examining records or systems.
Review cycles ensure long-term alignment.
They are time-based rather than event-driven.
Outcomes are documented for reference.

## Restriction

A limitation placed on access or interaction.
Restrictions are applied contextually.
They may be partial or complete.
All restrictions are logged.

## Stability

A condition in which systems operate within expected parameters.
Stability is evaluated over extended periods.
Temporary variance does not imply instability.
Stability assessments are comparative.

## Variance

A deviation from documented expectations.
Variance is measured rather than judged.
Small variances are common.
Significant variance may prompt review.

## Alignment

Consistency between actions and documented structure.
Alignment is evaluated at system level.
Misalignment is recorded, not immediately corrected.
Long-term trends are prioritized.

## Continuity

The preservation of function across time.
Continuity reduces dependence on individuals.
Documentation supports continuity.
Disruptions are recorded for analysis.
